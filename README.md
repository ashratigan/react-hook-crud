## React Hook CRUD Tutorial

Followed a simple tutorial to build a CRUD app using react hooks

The tutorial I followed is available here: [https://www.taniarascia.com/crud-app-in-react-with-hooks/](https://www.taniarascia.com/crud-app-in-react-with-hooks/)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
